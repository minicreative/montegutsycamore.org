### Mission
- To produce and share as much food as possible
- To build and share knowledge about growing vegetables in the New Orleans climate
- To create a space for people to learn about and eat food together
- To build healthy soil

### What's Growing

I planted these seedlings in early March: **cherry tomatoes, creole tomatoes, green bell peppers, purple bell peppers, habenero peppers and shishito peppers** from [Hot Plants](https://www.hotplantsnursery.com/); **roma tomatoes, okra, cucumbers, summer squash, and herbs (cilantro, parsley, basil)** from [Harold's Plants](https://www.haroldsplants.com/).

I planted these seeds in early March: **kale, collards, carrots, turnips, spinach, arugula, cabbage, chard, romaine lettuce and potatoes**. Most seeds were sourced from the Mini Seed Library at [1811 Louisa St](https://goo.gl/maps/oLDdyWYPLALtQKjf7)

My fall garden died during the freeze at Christmas. In mid-January, I planted some cover crops (rye and mustard) I got for free (thanks!) from [Sprout NOLA](https://www.sproutnolafarm.org/)'s Cover Crop session. I tilled these into the soil in early March, along with compost from [Schmelly's Dirt Farm](https://www.schmellys.com/).

No plants are currently producing food! Check back in April.

### About

My name's Tomas Roy. I've been living on Montegut Street since August 2021 when I took a job with Habitat for Humanity building affordable houses in the Ninth Ward, which is still my day job. I've been dreaming about the idea of caring for a small piece of land since I was a kid, and I'm overjoyed to be able to do it in my favorite city on earth. I'm excited about staying in one place, watching the seasons change and the trees grow.

I'd love to hear from you! Shoot me an email at [tomasroy7@gmail.com](mailto:tomasroy7@gmail.com)
