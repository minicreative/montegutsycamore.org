The garden is a work in progress, with the ultimate goal of producing free produce for neighbors.

### What's Growing
The fall garden died during the freeze at Christmas. In mid January a cover crop of rye and mustard was planted in all rows of 1833 Montegut, and this was tilled into the soil in early March. Rows were ammended with compost from [Schmelly's Dirt Farm](https://www.schmellys.com/).

The following seedlings were planted in early March: **cherry tomatoes, creole tomatoes, green bell peppers, purple bell peppers, habenero peppers and shishito peppers** from [Hot Plants](https://www.hotplantsnursery.com/); **roma tomatoes, okra, cucumbers, summer squash, and herbs (cilantro, parsley, basil)** from [Harold's Plants](https://www.haroldsplants.com/).

The following seeds were planted in early March: **kale, collards, carrots, turnips, spinach, arugula, cabbage, chard, romaine lettuce and potatoes**. Most seeds were sourced from the Mini Seed Library at [1811 Louisa St](https://goo.gl/maps/oLDdyWYPLALtQKjf7)

No plants are currently producing food! Check back in April.
