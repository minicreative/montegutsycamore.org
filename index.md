### Mission
- To produce and share as much food as possible
- To build and share knowledge about growing vegetables in the New Orleans climate
- To create a space for people to learn about and eat food together
- To build healthy soil

### What's Growing

All excess produce (everything my neighbors and I aren't eating) is taken to [St. Roch Metalworks](https://www.google.com/maps/place/St.+Roch+Metal+Works/@29.9844956,-90.0529212,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x86258470925b3fa4?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjGh9rgs86BAxXORDABHcTaAG0Q_BJ6BAhDEAA&ved=2ahUKEwjGh9rgs86BAxXORDABHcTaAG0Q_BJ6BAhNEAg) food distro which happens every Sunday at 4pm.

Fall 2023 crops: a few **cabbage and collard** plants that I started in trays at the end of the summer, lots of **pac choi, chard, kale, kholrabi and mustard green** starts from my friend Anwyn, and **carrots, radishes, arugula, green onions, mustard, kale and cilantro** seeded November 9 with seeds from Anna Timmerman's. Half of my production lot has been cover cropped with clover and rye since October 1.

Summer 2023 crops: **okra (multiple varities), eggplant (multiple varieties), habeneros, jalepenos, and basil,** sourced primarily from free seedlings and seeds found at Anna Timmerman's. I also grew, cured and processed about 7 ounces of [perique tabacco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perique).

Spring 2023 crops: **cherry tomatoes, creole tomatoes, green bell peppers, purple bell peppers, habenero peppers and shishito peppers** from [Hot Plants](https://www.hotplantsnursery.com/); **roma tomatoes, okra, cucumbers, summer squash, and herbs (cilantro, parsley, basil)** from [Harold's Plants](https://www.haroldsplants.com/), **kale, chard, collards, arugula, cucumbers, squash, bush beans and basil** started from seeds found at Anna Timmerman's Mini Seed Library at [1811 Louisa St](https://goo.gl/maps/oLDdyWYPLALtQKjf7)

My Fall 2022 garden died during the freeze at Christmas. In mid-January, I planted cover crop seed (rye and mustard) I got for free (thanks!) from [Sprout NOLA](https://www.sproutnolafarm.org/)'s Cover Crop session. I tilled these into the soil in early March, along with compost from [Schmelly's Dirt Farm](https://www.schmellys.com/).

### About

My name's Tomas Roy. I've been living on Montegut Street since August 2021 when I took a job with Habitat for Humanity building affordable houses in the Ninth Ward. I've been dreaming about the idea of caring for a small piece of land since I was a kid, and I'm overjoyed to be able to do it in my favorite city on earth. I'm excited about staying in one place, watching the seasons change and the trees grow.

I'd love to hear from you! Shoot me an email at [tomasroy7@gmail.com](mailto:tomasroy7@gmail.com)
